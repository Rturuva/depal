## Digital Earth Pacific Abstraction Library

### Overview
The PanGeo environment used by **Digital Earth Pacific** consists of several powerful libraries which have a high-learning curve,
such as *Xarray* for multi-dimensional raster data processing, *GeoPandas* for vector data processing, *Rasterio* for
data input/output, *TorchGeo* for machine learning pipelines etc. In addition, users need to have intermediate to
advanced competency in the Python programming language.

To alleviate and expedite capacity building for non-programmers and intermediate GIS technicians, DEP has implemented and
embeds the DEP **Abstraction Library** (DEPAL) into the computing hub environment, which enables users to
quickly undertake common tasks with fewer lines of codes.

Some examples of the functionalities provisioned by the abstraction library includes: defining “area of interest”
by Pacific Island Countrie's national, maritime and administrative boundaries, rapidly querying STAC catalog on images and banding,
undertaking multi spectral analysis like NDVI and creating cloud composites, etc. DEP will continue to extend
and simplify the abstraction library based on end-user feedback.
